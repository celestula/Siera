It took sometime, but I found the easiest way of getting this started was to fork this to my repository and edit to my perference. 
My blog will mostly be about myself going through computer science. I'm mainly using it as a way to keep track of my weaknesses and ways I overcame it. I hope at the very least it shows that anyone can accomplish what they want with determination and will. I started CS with no programming experience.

My goal is to post one blog entry per night of my day. On the weekend I will do a conclusion post. Sunday will probably be a little off topic with an outline of the tasks I need to do Mon-Fri. I hope everyone can finish strong this semester and all your finals are As.
