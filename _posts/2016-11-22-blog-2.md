Today was difficult. Not that the work was diffcult, but life kept interfering. My landlord was here fixing a light switch and vent fan. However, it did not go smoothly. This was a day where my studying took a backseat to real life, which wasn't my ideal way to spend the day. But some progress was made.

I was able to study my software engineering flash cards and feel I will get a good grade on my final, which is still a couple of weeks away. More importantly tonight I was able to finish writing the sections I was assigned for my team's SRS document. Once I reread it tomorrow I will email it to them. I also studied some spanish pharses. Overall today wasn't the best but I am still happy that progress was made.

Tomorrow may be another day where life gets in the way of my intended study goals. The landlord should be here with an electrican to finish fixing the electrical issues. I also have a responsibility to make some side dishes for Thanksgiving. I will just keep doing my best until I reach my goals. I'm disappointed I have come further along in my C++ studies but I sure I will get there.
