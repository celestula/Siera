This Thursday was Thanksgiving in the United States. For obvious reasons I took a significant break from studying that day. I overate, over drank, and over slept the following day. Today overall was a normal study day for me.

I worked on coming up with constraints and user characteristics for the team project SRS document that is due in a couple of weeks. I think our project is coming along nicely. I'm anxious to record the presentation portion of this assignment. Soon. Today I worked on my use case story. I had one done previously, however I didn't think it was good enough. I redid one today and plan to email my team to see if they're okay with it. It's a user story for searching for a train ticket and how the database ties in with the train ticket system. Other than study flash cards for my exams coming up I gave myself more time to look at C++. I'm getting there..I hope.

Mini to do list for Saturday:
* Flash cards (CEN, SPN)

* Submit Use case

* C++ review
