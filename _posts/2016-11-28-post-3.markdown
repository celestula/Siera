At last my day is complete. At least I feel good about stopping my studying for tonight now. Today is Monday and I always try to start my Mondays out strong. To do this is requires Sunday to also be halfway of a success. Why?![alt text](celestula.github.io/images/decwk52016.PNG "To Do List")

On Sunday I worked ahead and read my chapter on resilience for software engineering class and took the quiz since it was available already. I also cooked a healthy(ish) version of banana bread Sunday night, so on Monday I would already have a good breakfast waiting for me. After starting Monday morning with delicious bread and coffee I did four hours of flashcards. This is much higher frequency than normal for me because I have 1 final this weekend and the other one a week later. This semester didn't plan out as intended, so I have a lighter course load -- but I'll be the one to pay for it later.

Anyway, after flashcards for all morning I ate lunch/watched tv. After that I did some reading on C++. This is where the day went downhill because I took an afternoon nap. After I woke up I did some more reading but it was as productive as I wanted it to be. Before I knew it I needed to make dinner, so I did that; watched more tv. After TV time I got back to the book and was able to finish it. I worked on a section of the SRS document while watching TV Star (Korean variety show). Now I have completed everything for studying on my Monday to do list.
